# Multi-Object-Tracking-in-python

This repository contains implementation of various multi-object trackers. Main goal is to demonstrate principles of work this trackers in educational proposes. This project is built upon this course [youtube ðŸ“º](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa2-fpj6AV8T6JK1uTRuFpw/featured) and MATLAB open sourced implementations.

You can dive into in tutorial notebook (locally or in colab). Or explore code explicitly.

# Installation in virtualenv

```
pip install .
```

As a depencies package manager this project use PDM.
