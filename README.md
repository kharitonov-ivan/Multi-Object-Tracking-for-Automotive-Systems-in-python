[![Python 3.10](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)

This repository contains implementation of various multi-object trackers. 

In addition, it includes is tutorial with goal to demonstrate principles of work this trackers in educational proposes. It is unfluenced by the Multiple Object Tracking course in Chalmers and Edx [youtube ðŸ“º](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa2-fpj6AV8T6JK1uTRuFpw/featured) and MATLAB open sourced implementations.

You can dive into in tutorial notebook (locally or in colab). Or explore code explicitly.

```
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```

# Development

As a dependencies package manager this project use PDM.

Install pre-commit

```bash
pre-commit install
```
